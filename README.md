Visualize N-dimensional data in 2D

Plots multidimensional data in two dimensions. Distance between classes in higher dimensions are preserved in the visualization, making it a powerful tool to identify relationships between multidimensional data.  

Uses Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for clustering. A good place to know more about the SOM techniques is http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html.
